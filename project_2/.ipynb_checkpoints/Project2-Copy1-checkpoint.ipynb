Where Logistic Regression was motivated probability theory, SVM is motivated by geometeric arguments. Specifcally, SVM finds a separating hyperline that maximizes the margin (i.e. distance from each class). The hyperplane is used to classify the points by designating every sample on of side of the hyperplane as the positive class and the other side as the negative class.\n",
